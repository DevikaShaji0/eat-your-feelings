## Project Description
Eat Your Feelings is the world‚Äôs first AI-powered emotional damage delivery service.  
Feeling sad? We‚Äôll serve you unhinged advice, meme-tier insults, and maybe a plate of biryani ‚Äî all in one go.  

---

## The Problem (that doesn‚Äôt exist)
Therapy is expensive, friends are busy, and your cat refuses to listen to your problems.  
We decided to solve this *urgent* crisis before humanity collapses into soggy cereal-level sadness.  

---

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)
An AI chatbot that demolishes your mood respectfully, serves savage life advice,  
and occasionally suggests food to cope ‚Äî because nothing says ‚Äúhealing‚Äù like carbs and sarcasm.
